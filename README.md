The process of identifying and resolving the causes and effects of a challenge or problem is known as causality analysis. This article will analyse the causality relationship between the Apple and Walmart stocks collected from Yahoo Finance from 30 June 2010 to 19 June 2014. The statistical methods used include the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF), Karl Person correlation coefficient method and Granger causality test. The ADF checks the stationarity of the time series, the Karl Person correlation coefficient method checks the correlation and the Granger causality test is used to find the elements.
